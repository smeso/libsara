libsara can be used to discover which S.A.R.A. LSM features are enabled
for a given process and to change them for the current process.
Given that it's very simple and that it's release under a very
permissive license (CC0 1.0 Universal) it can be easily modified
and used in any project.

To compile and install it just run:
	make

	sudo make install

To uninstall it run:
	sudo make uninstall
